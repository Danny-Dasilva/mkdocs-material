The following are extra features built into mkdocs Bash terminal \u00b6 Using termynal.js and termynal.css in /docs/js and /docs/js respectively we can show terminal output. By wraping a console code block in a div tag with class=\"termy\" you can display a loading promt as well as example output in your markdown files. This termynal styling is provided courtesy of FastApi Example : <div class=\"termy\"> ```console $ some_example_command.sh ---> 100% INFO: Started server process [28722] INFO: Application startup complete. ``` </div> Result : $ some_example_command.sh ---> 100% INFO: Started server process [28722] INFO: Application startup complete. Code Blocks \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension \u00b7 Supersedes: CodeHilite The Highlight extension, which is part of [Python Markdown Extensions][5], integrates with Material for MkDocs and provides several options for configuring syntax highlighting of code blocks, to see how to set up and configure this see the mkdocs-material documentation Usage \u00b6 Code blocks must be enclosed with two separate lines containing three backticks. To add code highlighting to those blocks, add the language short name directly after the opening block. See the list of available lexers to find the short name for a given language. Example : ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` Result : import tensorflow as tf Adding line numbers \u00b6 Line numbers can be added to a code block by using the linenums=\"<start>\" option directly after the short name, whereas <start> represents the starting line number. A code block can start from a line number other than 1 , which allows splitting large code blocks for readability. Example : ``` python linenums=\"1\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 1 2 3 4 5 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Starting at a different line number The number passed into range () will be the start of the line Example : ``` python linenums=\"7\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : 7 8 9 10 11 def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting specific lines \u00b6 Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language short name. Note that line counts start at 1 , regardless of the starting line number specified as part of linenums . Example : ``` python hl_lines=\"2 3\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result : def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Highlighting inline code With InlineHilite enabled, inline code blocks can be highlighted by prefixing them with a shebang-like sequence, i.e. #! , directly followed by the short language name 17 . Example : The `#!python range()` function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Result : The range () function is used to generate a sequence of numbers. Admonitions \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Extension Admonitions, also known as call-outs, are an devent choice for including side content without significantly interrupting the document flow. Material for MkDocs provides several different types of admonitions and allows for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content. A details block follows the syntax and semantics of admonition blocks, but must start with ??? . The ??? can then be followed by a admonition type e.g. example (view supported types) . Collapsed Blocks \u00b6 Example : ??? example Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Example Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Open blocks \u00b6 You can add a \"title\" by adding quotations after your supported admonition type (view supported types) . Adding a + after ??? will render the block as open on page load: Example : ???+ note \"Example Title\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Example Title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. There are many supported admonition types and these can be added to explain bugs or issues users may encounter. You can fit code blocks or any other mkdocs markdown inside these blocks so feel free to use them to add collapsible content. No title Icon or Bar Similar to changing the title, the icon and title can be omitted entirely by adding an empty string directly after the type qualifier. Note that this will not work for collapsible blocks. !!! note \"\" Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Images \u00b6 You can add images using the following syntax ![Placeholder_text](path/to/img.jpg) . You can add images in the docs/img folder and reference them in markdown. When the Attribute List extension is enabled, images can be aligned by adding the respective alignment directions via the align attribute, i.e. align=left or align=right . Along with this you can assign width with the syntax width=200 . Allignment \u00b6 Left Example : ![Placeholder](img/example.png){: align=left width=300 } Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Right Example : ![Placeholder](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){: align=right } Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. If there's insufficient space to render the text next to the image, the image will stretch to the full width of the viewport, e.g. on mobile viewports. Image captions \u00b6 Sadly, the Markdown syntax doesn't provide native support for image captions, but it's always possible to resort to HTML. Using figure and figcaption , captions can be added to images. Example : < figure > < img src = \"https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa\" width = \"300\" /> < figcaption > Image caption </ figcaption > </ figure > Result : Image caption Image lazy-loading Modern browsers provide native support for lazy-loading images through the loading attribute, which degrades to eager-loading in browsers without support. As with [image alignment][5], if the Attribute List extension is enabled, images can be lazy-loaded by adding loading=lazy . Example : ![Placeholder](https://dummyimage.com/600x400/eee/aaa){: loading=lazy } Content tabs \u00b6 Sometimes, it's desirable to group alternative content under different tabs, e.g. when describing how to access an API from different languages or environments. Material for MkDocs allows for beautiful and functional tabs, grouping code blocks and other content see example docs . Example : === \"C\" ``` c #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello world!\\n\"); return 0; } ``` === \"C++\" ``` c++ #include <iostream> int main(void) { std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; return 0; } ``` Result : C #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello world! \\n \" ); return 0 ; } C++ #include <iostream> int main ( void ) { std :: cout << \"Hello world!\" << std :: endl ; return 0 ; } Grouping other content With InlineHilite enabled, inline code blocks can be highlighted by prefixing them with a shebang-like sequence, i.e. #! , directly followed by the short language name 17 . Example : === \"Example Content\" ### Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet `Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet` === \"Ordered list\" 1. Sed sagittis eleifend rutrum 2.

Material design, font awesome and octicons icons are supported Emojis and Icons can be integrated in Markdown by putting the shortcode of the emoji between two colons. To see how to add custom css rules to Icons as well as custom Icons see the mkdocs icon documentation . Example : :smile: :material-account-circle: \u2013 `.icons/material/account-circle.svg` :fontawesome-regular-laugh-wink: \u2013 `.icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg` :octicons-octoface-16: \u2013 `.icons/octicons/octoface-16.svg` Result : \u2013 .icons/material/account-circle.svg \u2013 .icons/fontawesome/regular/laugh-wink.svg \u2013 .icons/octicons/octoface-16.svg Data tables \u00b6 Data tables can be used at any position in your project documentation and can contain arbitrary Markdown, including inline code blocks, as well as icons and emojis . Example : | Method | Description | | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | | `GET` | :material-check: Fetch resource | | `PUT` | :material-check-all: Update resource | | `DELETE` | :material-close: Delete resource | Result : Method Description GET Fetch resource PUT Update resource DELETE Delete resource Tasklists \u00b6 When the Tasklist extension is enabled, unordered list items can be prefixed with [ ] to render an unchecked or [x] to render a checked checkbox. Along with normal markdown lists which can be prefficed with * or 1. tasklists provide you a way of annotating completed tasks. Example : * [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit * [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt * [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst * [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus * [ ] Praesent sed risus massa * [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Result : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Footnotes and Links \u00b6 Footnotes are a great way to add references to supplemental or additional information for a specific section of a document without interrupting the document flow. Material for MkDocs provides the ability to insert inline footnotes and render them at the bottom of the page. A footnote reference must be enclosed in square brackets and must start with a caret ^ , directly followed by an arbitrary identifier, which is similar to the standard Markdown link syntax. Along with this you can just use an arbitrary identifier in square brackets to insert a link. Example : Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Lorem ipsum[1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit[2]. Result : Lorem ipsum 1 dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit . Adding footnote content \u00b6 The footnote content must be declared with the same identifier as the reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink to the footnote reference is automatically added. on a single line \u00b6 Short statements can be written on the same line. Example : [^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
